# Image-scrapper-from-Google-image-search

It makes use of selenium and chrome web driver to auto scroll through Google image search results.



The chrome driver for different operating system can be downloaded from this [link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). I have only included the windows chrome driver since I personally use windows 10 operating system.

Once downloaded your corresponding selenium chrome web driver, Change the DRIVER_PATH variable in the ipython notebook. 
Also if you do not have selenium installed on os,

you can type the following on your command line interface [or] terminal:

```python
pip install selenium, pillow, requests, BeautifulSoup
```



Edit the search string as well as the destination folder path.

Enjoy!
